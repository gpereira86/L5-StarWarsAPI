## 3. Password-Protected Route for Retrieving Logs from Database
- **Description**: A secure route was created, protected by a password (api key), to allow for the retrieval of logs stored in the database.
- **Objective**: Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information, such as system logs.
- **Benefit**: Enhanced security in managing system data, preventing unauthorized access to confidential information.
